# Advanced Gaming

This repository has been created
whilst reading the Advanced Game Design by
**Rex van der Spuy**
published by **Apress**

It basically goes through all the
JavaScript tools required to use
in advanced game development. It's
well worth a read and I'd recommend
it to anyone who's slightly
inteseted in getting into creating
games with JS HTML & bits of CSS.

There are plenty of notes in the
JS files and some pretty fun things
going on. I think my favourite was:

**"The Dragon attacks with flaming furballs"**

...that was pretty funny!

But, there's loads more on objects,
ES6 modules, promises, localStorage,
making your game full screen
...and more.

Next, we are going to take a crash course in drawing stuff on the
html canvas element. Stuff we've touched on before, but I'm looking
forward to this little adventure.

Take a look in the canvas folder and....

OK! We finished with the canvas folder as we are getting into working with sprites. In hindsight, we should have moved out a little while ago, probably before we made the assets object / module which is responsible for pre-loading all the game assets before initialising the game itself.


See the sprites folder....

Latest update is in the movements folder....


Stay tuned :-)
